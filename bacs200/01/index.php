These applications include Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts; each one has the tools for video group calls. Another popular example is YouTube, this website has a variety of tools that allow for online communication and sharing. A tool such as Live Stream allows for a YouTube user to post a live video that can be seen by anyone in the world. YouTube is also home to a massive platform of user made videos that have a wide variety of content.Amazon is taking shopping to another level with their brand-new store in Los Angeles, in this store purchases are all made digitally with virtually no need for cashiers. As soon as you walk into the store you are identified by your Amazon members account. Whatever items you choose to buy, will be charged  to your account once you leave the store.Google has introduced many of todayâ€™s digital platforms that have already been intergraded into our education system.
